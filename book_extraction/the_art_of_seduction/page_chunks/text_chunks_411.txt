If your targets become too used to you as the ag-
gressor, they will give less of their own energy, and the
tension will slacken. You need to wake them up, turn the
tables. Once they are under your spell, take a step back and
they will start to come after you. Begin with a touch of aloof-
ness, an unexpected nonappearance, a hint that you are grow-
ing bored. Stir the pot by seeming interested in someone else.
Make none of this explicit; let them only sense it and their
imagination will do the rest, creating the doubt you desire.
Soon they will want to possess you physically, and re-
straint will go out the window. The goal is to have them
fall into your arms of their own will. Create the
illusion that the seducer is being seduced.Give Them Space to Fallâ€”
The Pursuer Is Pursued
