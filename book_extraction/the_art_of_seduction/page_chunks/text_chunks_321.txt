Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability â€¢ 293
Reversal
Timing is everything in seduction; you should always look for signs that
the target is falling under your spell. A person falling in love tends to
ignore the other person's weaknesses, or to see them as endearing. An
unseduced, rational person, on the other hand, may find bashfulness or
emotional outbursts pathetic. There are also certain weaknesses that have
no seductive value, no matter how in love the target may be.
The great seventeenth-century courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos liked men
with a soft side. But sometimes a man would go too far, complaining that
she did not love him enough, that she was too fickle and independent, that
he was being mistreated and wronged. For Ninon, such behavior would
break the spell, and she would quickly end the relationship. Complaining,
whining, neediness, and actively appealing for sympathy will appear to your
targets not as charming weaknesses but as manipulative attempts at a kind of
negative power. So when you play the victim, do it subtly, without overad-
vertising it. The only weaknesses worth playing up are the ones that will
make you seem lovable. All others should be repressed and eradicated at all
costs.
