Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo
There are always social limits on what one can do.
Some of these, the most elemental taboos, go back centuries;
others are more superficial, simply defining polite and accept-
able behavior. Making your targets feel that you are leading them
past either kind of limit is immensely seductive. People yearn to ex-
plore their dark side. Not everything in romantic love is supposed to
be tender and soft; hint that you have a cruel, even sadistic streak.
You do not respect age differences, marriage vows, family ties. Once
the desire to transgress draws your targets to you, it will be hard for
them to stop. Take them further than they imaginedâ€”the shared
feeling of guilt and complicity will create a powerful bond.
