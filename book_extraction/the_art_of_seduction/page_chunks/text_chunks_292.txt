Pay Attention to Detail
Lofty
words and grand
gestures can be suspi-
cious: why are you trying
so hard to please? The details
of a seduction—the subtle ges-
tures, the offhand things you do—
are often more charming and
revealing. You must learn to distract
your victims with a myriad of pleasant
little rituals—thoughtful gifts tailored
just for them, clothes and adornments
designed to please them, gestures that
show the time and attention you are
paying them. All of their senses are
engaged in the details you orchestrate.
Create spectacles to dazzle their
eyes; mesmerized by what they
see, they will not notice what
you are really up to. Learn to
suggest the proper feelings
and moods through
details.
