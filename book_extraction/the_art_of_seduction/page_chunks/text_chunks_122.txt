Charisma
is a presence that excites us. It
comes from an inner quality—self-confi-
dence, sexual energy, sense of purpose, content-
ment—that most people lack and want. This
quality radiates outward, permeating the gestures
of Charismatics, making them seem extraordinary
and superior, and making us imagine there is more
to them than meets the eye: they are gods, saints,
stars. Charismatics can learn to heighten their
charisma with a piercing gaze, fiery oratory,
an air of mystery. They can seduce on a
grand scale. Learn to create the
charismatic illusion by radiating
intensity while remain-
ing detached.
