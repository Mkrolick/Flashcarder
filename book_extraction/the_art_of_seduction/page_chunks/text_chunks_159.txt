Se-
ducers draw
you in by the fo-
cused, individualized atten-
tion they pay to you. Anti-Seducers
are the opposite: insecure, self-absorbed,
and unable to grasp the psychology of an-
other person, they literally repel. Anti-
Seducers have no self-awareness, and never
realize when they are pestering, imposing,
talking too much. They lack the subtlety
to create the promise of pleasure that seduc-
tion requires. Root out anti-seductive
qualities in yourself, and recognize them
in othersâ€”there is no pleasure or profit
in dealing with the Anti-Seducer.
