Master the Art of Insinuation
Making your targets feel dis-
satisfied and in need of your atten-
tion is essential, but if you are too obvious,
they will see through you and grow defensive.
There is no known defense, however,
against insinuation—the art of plant-
ing ideas in people's minds by
dropping elusive hints that
take root days later, even
appearing to them as
their own idea. Insinua-
tion is the supreme means
of influencing people. Cre-
ate a sublanguage—bold state-
ments followed by retraction and
apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk
combined with alluring glances—that enters
the target's unconscious to convey your real
meaning. Make everything suggestive.
