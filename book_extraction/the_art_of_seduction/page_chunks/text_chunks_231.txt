Create a Needâ€”
Stir Anxiety and Discontent
A perfectly satisfied
person cannot be seduced. Tension and
disharmony must be instilled in your targets' minds. Stir
within them feelings of discontent, an unhappiness with their
circumstances and with themselves: their life lacks adventure, they
have strayed from the ideals of their youth, they have become boring.
The feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to in-
sinuate yourself, to make them see you as the answer to their
problems. Pain and anxiety are the proper precursors to
pleasure. Learn to manufacture the need
that you can fill.
