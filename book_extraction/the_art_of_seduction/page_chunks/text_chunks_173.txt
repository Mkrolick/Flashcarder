The Anti-Seducer • 145
Uses of Anti-Seduction
The best way to avoid entanglements with Anti-Seducers is to recognize
them right away and give them a wide berth, but they often deceive
us. Involvements with these types are painful, and are hard to disengage
from, because the more emotional response you show, the more engaged
you seem to be. Do not get angry—that may only encourage them or
exacerbate their anti-seductive tendencies. Instead, act distant and indiffer-
ent, pay no attention to them, make them feel how little they matter to
you. The best antidote to an Anti-Seducer is often to be anti-seductive
yourself.
Cleopatra had a devastating effect on every man who crossed her path.
Octavius—the future Emperor Augustus, and the man who would de-
feat and destroy Cleopatra's lover Mark Antony—was well aware of her
power, and defended himself against it by being always extremely amiable
with her, courteous to the extreme, but never showing the slightest emo-
tion, whether of interest or dislike. In other words, he treated her as if she
were any other woman. Facing this front, she could not sink her hooks into
him. Octavius made anti-seduction his defense against the most irresistible
woman in history. Remember: seduction is a game of attention, of slowly
filling the other person's mind with your presence. Distance and inattention
will create the opposite effect, and can be used as a tactic when the need
arises.
Finally, if you really want to "anti-seduce," simply feign the qualities
listed at the beginning of the chapter. Nag; talk a lot, particularly about
yourself; dress against the other person's tastes; pay no attention to detail;
suffocate, and so on. A word of warning: with the arguing type, the Wind-
bag, never talk back too much. Words will only fan the flames. Adopt the
Queen Victoria strategy: nod, seem to agree, then find an excuse to cut the
conversation short. This is the only defense.
