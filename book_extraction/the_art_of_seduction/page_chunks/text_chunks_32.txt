4 • The Art of Seduction
posite potential within you—the power of repulsion. At all cost you must
root out any anti-seductive tendencies you may have.
Think of the nine types as shadows, silhouettes. Only by stepping into
one of them and letting it grow inside you can you begin to develop the
seductive character that will bring you limitless power.
A
man is often
secretly oppressed by
the role he has to
play—by always having to
be responsible, in control, and
rational. The Siren is the ulti-
mate male fantasy figure because
she offers a total release from the
limitations of his life. In her pres-
ence, which is always heightened and
sexually charged, the male feels
transported to a world of pure plea-
sure. She is dangerous, and in pursu-
ing her energetically the man can lose
control over himself something he
yearns to do. The Siren is a mirage;
she lures men by cultivating a par-
ticular appearance and manner.
In a world where women are
often too timid to project such
an image, learn to take
control of the male li-
bido by embodying
his fantasy.
