Keep Them in Suspense—What Comes Next? • 249
Reversal
Surprise can be unsurprising if you keep doing the same thing again and
again. Jiang Qing would try to surprise her husband Mao Zedong with
sudden changes of mood, from harshness to kindness and back. At first he
was captivated; he loved the feeling of never knowing what was coming.
But it went on for years, and was always the same. Soon, Madame Mao's
supposedly unpredictable mood swings just annoyed him. You need to vary
the method of your surprises. When Madame de Pompadour was the lover
of the inveterately bored King Louis XV, she made each surprise different—
a new amusement, a new game, a new fashion, a new mood. He could
never predict what would come next, and while he waited for the next sur-
prise, his willpower was temporarily suspended. No man was ever more of
a slave to a woman than was Louis to Madame de Pompadour. When you
change direction, make the new direction truly new.
