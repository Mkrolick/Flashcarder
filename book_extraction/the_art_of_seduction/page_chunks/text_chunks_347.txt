Phase Three
The Precipice—
Deepening the Effect Through
Extreme Measures
The goal in this phase is to make everything deeper—the effect you have
on their mind, feelings of love and attachment, tension within your vic-
tims. With your hooks deep into them, you can then push them back
and forth, between hope and despair, until they weaken and snap. Show-
ing how far you are willing to go for your victims, doing some noble or
chivalrous deed (16: Prove yourself) will create a powerful jolt, spark an
intensely positive reaction. Everyone has scars, repressed desires, and un-
finished business from childhood. Bring these desires and wounds to the
surface, make your victims feel they are getting what they never got as a
child and you will penetrate deep into their psyche, stir uncontrollable
emotions (17: Effect a regression). Now you can take your victims past
their limits, getting them to act out their dark sides, adding a sense of
danger to your seduction (18: Stir up the transgressive and taboo).
You need to deepen the spell, and nothing will more confuse and enchant
your victims than giving your seduction a spiritual veneer. It is not lust
that motivates you, but destiny, divine thoughts and everything elevated
(19: Use spiritual lures). The erotic lurks beneath the spiritual. Now
your victims have been properly set up. By deliberately hurting them,
instilling fears and anxieties, you will lead them to the edge of the
precipice from which it will be easy to push and make them fall (20: Mix
pleasure with pain). They feel great tension and are yearning for relief.
