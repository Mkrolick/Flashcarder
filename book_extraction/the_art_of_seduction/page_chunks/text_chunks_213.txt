Send Mixed Signals
Once people are aware of your presence, and
perhaps vaguely intrigued, you need to stir their
interest before it settles on someone else. What is ob-
vious and striking may attract their attention at first, but
that attention is often short-lived; in the long run, ambi-
guity is much more potent. Most of us are much too obvi-
ousâ€”instead, be hard to figure out. Send mixed signals:
both tough and tender, both spiritual and earthy, both inno-
cent and cunning. A mix of qualities suggests depth, which
fascinates even as it confuses. An elusive, enigmatic aura
will make people want to know more, drawing them
into your circle. Create such a power by hinting
at something contradictory within you.
