Use Spiritual Lures • 367
Symbol: The Stars in the sky. Objects of worship for cen-
turies, and symbols of the sublime and divine. In contemplat-
ing them, we are momentarily distracted from everything
mundane and mortal. We feel lightness. Lift your tar-
gets' minds up to the stars and they will not
notice what is happening here
on earth.
Reversal
Letting your targets feel that your affection is neither temporary nor
superficial will often make them fall deeper under your spell. In some,
though, it can arouse an anxiety: the fear of commitment, of a claustro-
phobic relationship with no exits. Never let your spiritual lures seem to be
leading in that direction, then. To focus attention on the distant future may
implicitly constrict their freedom; you should be seducing them, not offer-
ing to marry them. What you want is to make them lose themselves in the
moment, experiencing the timeless depth of your feelings in the present
tense. Religious ecstasy is about intensity, not temporal extensity.
Giovanni Casanova used many spiritual lures in his seductions—the oc-
cult, anything that would inspire lofty sentiments. For the time that he was
involved with a woman, she would feel that he would do anything for her,
that he was not just using her only to abandon her. But she also knew that
when it became convenient to end the affair, he would cry, give her a mag-
nificent gift, then quietly leave. This was just what many young women
wanted—a temporary diversion from marriage or an oppressive family.
Sometimes pleasure is best when we know it is fleeting.that you learn to put the
devil back in Hell, for it is
greatly to His liking and
pleasurable to the parties
concerned, and a great deal
of good can arise and flow
in the process.
