Appear to Be an Object of Desire
—Create Triangles
Few are drawn to the person whom others avoid or ne-
glect; people gather around those who have already at-
tracted interest. We want what other people want. To draw
your victims closer and make them hungry to possess you, you
must create an aura of desirability—of being wanted and
courted by many. It will become a point of vanity for them to
be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away from
a crowd of admirers. Manufacture the illusion of popularity
by surrounding yourself with members of the opposite
sex—friends, former lovers, present suitors. Create tri-
angles that stimulate rivalry and raise your value.
Build a reputation that precedes you: if many
have succumbed to your charms,
there must be a reason.
