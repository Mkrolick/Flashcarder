Appendix A
Seductive Environment/Seductive Time
In se-
duction, your vic-
tims must slowly come
to feel an inner change.
Under your influence, they
lower their defenses, feeling free to
act differently, to be a different per-
son. Certain places, environments,
and experiences will greatly aid you in
your quest to change and transform the
seduced. Spaces with a theatrical,
heightened quality—opulence, glittering
surfaces, a playful spirit—create a buoy-
ant, childlike feeling that make it hard
for the victim to think straight. The cre-
ation of an altered sense of time has a
similar effect—memorable, dizzying
moments that stand out, a mood of
festival and play. You must make
your victims feel that being
with you gives them a dif-
ferent experience from
being in the real
world.
