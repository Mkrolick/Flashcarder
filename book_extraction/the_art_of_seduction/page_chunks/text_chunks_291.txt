Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion • 263
Reversal
Do not confuse flowery language with seduction: in using flowery lan-
guage you run the risk of wearing on people's nerves, of seeming
pretentious. Excess verbiage is a sign of selfishness, of your inability to rein
in your natural tendencies. Often with language, less is more; the elusive,
vague, ambiguous phrase leaves the listener more room for imagination
than does a sentence full of bombast and self-indulgence.
You must always think first of your targets, and of what will be pleasant
to their ears. There will be many times when silence is best. What you do
not say can be suggestive and eloquent, making you seem mysterious. In
the eleventh-century Japanese court diary The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon,
the counselor Yoshichika is intrigued by a lady he sees in a carriage, silent
and beautiful. He sends her a note, and she sends one back; he is the only
one to read it, but by his reaction everyone can tell it is in bad taste, or
badly written. It spoils the effect of her beauty. Shonagon writes, "I have
heard people suggest that no reply at all is better than a bad one." If you are
not eloquent, if you cannot master seductive language, at least learn to curb
your tongue—use silence to cultivate an enigmatic presence.
Finally, seduction has a pace and rhythm. In phase one, you are cautious
and indirect. It is often best to disguise your intentions, to put your target at
ease with deliberately neutral words. Your conversation should be harmless,
even a bit bland. In this second phase, you turn more to the attack; this is
the time for seductive language. Now when you envelop them in your se-
ductive words and letters, it comes as a pleasant surprise. It gives them the
immensely pleasing feeling that they are the ones to suddenly inspire you
with such poetry and intoxicating words.
