Disarm Through Strategic Weakness
and Vulnerability
Too much ma-
neuvering on your part may raise
suspicion. The best way to cover your tracks
is to make the other person feel superior and
stronger. If you seem to be weak, vulnerable, enthralled
by the other person, and unable to control yourself, you will
make your actions look more natural, less calculated. Physical
weakness—tears, bashfulness, paleness—will help create the ef-
fect. To further win trust, exchange honesty for virtue: establish
your "sincerity" by confessing some sin on your part—it doesn't
have to be real. Sincerity is more important than goodness. Play
the victim, then transform your target's sympathy into love.
