Create Temptation
Lure the target deep into your seduction by creating the
proper temptation: a glimpse of the pleasures to come. As
the serpent tempted Eve with the promise of forbidden
knowledge, you must awaken a desire in your tar-
gets that they cannot control. Find that weakness
of theirs, that fantasy that has yet to be real-
ized, and hint that you can lead them toward
it. It could be wealth, it could be adventure, it
could be forbidden and guilty pleasures; the
key is to keep it vague. Dangle the prize before
their eyes, postponing satisfaction, and let their
minds do the rest. The future seems ripe with possi-
bility. Stimulate a curiosity stronger than the doubts
and anxieties that go with it, and they will follow you.
