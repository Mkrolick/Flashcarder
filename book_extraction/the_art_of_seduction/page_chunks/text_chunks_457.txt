Beware the Aftereffects • 429
Reversal
To keep a person enchanted, you will have to re-seduce them con-
stantly. But you can allow a little familiarity to creep in. The target
wants to feel that he or she is getting to know you. Too much mystery will
create doubt. It will also be tiring for you, who will have to sustain it. The
point is not to remain completely unfamiliar but rather, on occasion, to jolt
victims out of their complacency, surprising them as you surprised them in
the past. Do this right and they will have the delightful feeling that they are
constantly getting to know more about you—but never too much.
