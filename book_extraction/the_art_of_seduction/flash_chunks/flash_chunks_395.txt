Term: Specific Targets for Re-Seduction 
Definition: Ideal targets for re-seduction are those who do not know you so well, whose memories of you are cleaner, who are less suspicious by nature, and who are dissatisfied with present circumstances. Timing is also important to allow past faults to fade away.

Term: Symbol: Embers 
Definition: The remains of the fire that symbolize the past relationship or previous seduction. These embers need constant attention and vigilance to be brought back to life.

Term: Aftereffects 
Definition: To maintain enchantment, one should re-seduce their target constantly but allow a little familiarity to creep in. The aim is not to remain completely unfamiliar but to surprise targets occasionally to keep them interested and constantly getting to know more about you. 

Term: Reversal 
Definition: The technique of allowing a target to feel they are getting to know you while essentially controlling what they get to know. Too much mystery may engender doubt, so it's crucial to strike a balance, ensuring that they are constantly discovering something new about you but never too much.
