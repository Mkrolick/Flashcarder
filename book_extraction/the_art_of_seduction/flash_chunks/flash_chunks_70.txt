Term: The Vulgarian

Term: Antidote to Anti-Seducer traits
Definition: One should avoid excessive self-consciousness, verbosity, sensitivity to one's ego, vulgar behavior, and stinginess in order to not repel potential suitors. It's better to be generous, bold, attentive to the comfort of others, and tactful. At the same time, personal hygiene should be maintained without being overly obsessive about one's looks.
