Term: Power in Ancient History
Definition: In ancient times, power was gained primarily through physical violence and maintained with brute strength. Kings and emperors often ruled mercilessly and women, in particular, suffered under this power structure due to lack of ability to compete or leverage their own power.

Term: Women's Power
Definition: Women in ancient times lacked the ability to compete with men for power, politically, socially, or within the domestic sphere. The only available power to be harnessed by women was in men's insatiable desire for sex, yet this power was seen as temporary and frail.

Term: The Invention of Seduction
Definition: Women yearning for power and who were creative and clever, invented a lasting and effective form of power - seduction. Famous examples include Bathsheba, Helen of Troy, Hsi Shi, and Cleopatra. They would attract men with their appearance and lure them into a world of luxury and pleasure, then become indifferent, forcing the men into a pursuit of lost pleasures.

Term: The Art of Seduction
Definition: The art of seduction was developed by women as they realized their ability to manipulate men using pleasure. They learned how to pique men's curiosity and imagination, arousing and directing desires as they pleased. This realization led to the creation of love and beauty, allowing women to have some form of control over men. 

Term: Women's Adaptation in Oppressive Societies
Definition: In emerging societies, women typically faced oppression and scorn. Over time, they learned to use their lesser physical strength to their advantage by mastering the skill of seduction. They understood that while men could dominate them through force, they could control men by providing pleasure. This was the dawn of women using seduction as a form of power.
