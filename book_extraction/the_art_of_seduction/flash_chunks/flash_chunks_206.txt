Term: Creating Emotion Through Writing
Definition: The goal of writing is not to express oneself but to provoke emotion in the reader, creating confusion and desire. It is effective when the reader mirrors the writer's thoughts, possibly repeating the words written. 

Term: Direct Expression Versus Implication
Definition: Instead of explicitly stating how you feel, it is more effective to imply the effect your reader has on you. Being vague and ambiguous allows the reader to imagine and fantasize.

Term: Seductive Language versus Normal Language
Definition: Normal language is used to express feelings, ideas, and opinions, while seductive language confuses, delights, and intoxicates. The ability to get outside one’s skin and inside another person’s mindset, controlling the urge to say the first thing on one’s mind, turns normal language into seductive language.

Term: The Power of Flattery
Definition: Flattery is seductive language in its purest form. Its purpose is to create an effect on the recipient, not to express truth or real feeling. Effective flattery targets the recipient's insecurities and validates them, making the person feel secure and alluring.

Term: Self-Absorption in Communication
Definition: It is human nature to be generally self-absorbed and to primarily use words to express our own thoughts and feelings. In seduction, this habit limits potential as one needs to be able to get outside of their own perspective and inside another person's psyche.

Term: The Quality of Music in Communication
Definition: Talking in a way that pleases and relates to the listener's lives is likened to music, something people enjoy that gets under their skin, rather than noise which is irritating and tuned out. To make music, words must say things that please or distract and entertain the listener, moving them and lowering their resistance.

Term: Connection between Language and Emotion
Definition: A rhythm or melody in language can impact one's moods and emotions in the same way as music, either relaxing or exciting a person. 

Term: Importance of Perspective in Seduction
Definition: The key to seductive language is a radical shift in perspective and habit. A speaker must step outside of their own beliefs and opinions and view things from the other's perspective to truly seduce them with language.
