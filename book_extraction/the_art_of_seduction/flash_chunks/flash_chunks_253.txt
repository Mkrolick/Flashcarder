Term: Fantasy and the Mind
Definition: The human mind has two currents: it tends to believe in pleasant things, yet it has a defense mechanism that makes it suspicious. If you start off too theatrical in creating a fantasy, the suspicious side of the mind gets triggered, raising doubts. The best approach is to build trust slowly, igniting interest with a slight hint of something unusual or thrilling. With a basis of trust, the fantasies you weave become convincing.
