Term: Typology of the Anti-Seducers
Definition: The main types of Anti-Seducers include The Brute, The Suffocator, The Moralizer, and The Tightwad. 

Term: The Brute
Definition: They are concerned only with their own pleasure, never with yours. Brutes have no patience for the duration and anticipation of seduction which makes it pleasurable. Their ego prevents them from thinking of the other person.

Term: The Suffocator
Definition: People who fall in love quickly before the other person is even half-aware of their existence. They suffer from an inner void, a deep well of need that cannot be filled. They idealize a loved one quickly and smother the person with guilt.

Term: The Moralizer
Definition: Rigid people who follow fixed ideas and try to make you bend to their standards. They want to change you, hence, they endlessly criticize and judge. Their moral ideas stem from their own unhappiness, which they project onto those around them.

Term: The Tightwad
Definition: People characterized by cheapness. This trait indicates more than a problem with money; it signifies an unwillingness for risk-taking or letting go. It is a significant anti-seductive quality as it shows a constricted character.

Term: Recognizing Anti-Seducers
Definition: It is essential to recognize anti-seductive qualities in others and ourselves to avoid an unsatisfying relationship. Some clues of self-involvement and insecurity include ungenerosity, tenacity in arguing, excessive judgment, undeserved praise, and inattention to details.
