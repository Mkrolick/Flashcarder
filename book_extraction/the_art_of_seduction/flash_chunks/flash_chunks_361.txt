Term: Physical Lures
Definition: Techniques used to attract someone towards themselves using physical aspects, such as body language, expressions, and tone of voice.

The use of physical lures is alluded to with the onstage presence of La Belle Otero and her mastery of personalised sexuality.

Term: The element of Surprise in Seduction

Term: Selective Exposure
Definition: In order to make the target feel that he is causing a certain reaction in the seducer; maintain a measure of reservation in the initial stages of the interaction. Only expose your desire when you sense that the target is invested in you. This strategy was used by La Belle Otero to make men believe they were the cause of her sexual desire. 

Term: Lowering Inhibitions
Definition: This strategy refers to creating an environment or situation where the target feels comfortable and at ease. This comfort allows them to lower their guard and become more amenable to the seduction process. The story of Tuperselai and Errol Flynn is an example where Flynn's politeness and keeping a safe distance allowed Tuperselai to lower her guard. 

Term: The Illusion of Desire

Term: Making the First Move

Term: The Power of Suggestion
Definition: The ability to subtly direct a person's thoughts or actions through implication, innuendo, or indirect reference. Often used in the context of seduction, it enables the seducer to steer the interaction without appearing to make overt gestures. The exchange between Errol Flynn and Blanca Rosa Welter demonstrates the power of suggestion.

Term: The Role of Confidence in Seduction
Definition: Confidence is key in the stage of attraction. A confident demeanor can be enticing and highly attractive. As seen in the example of Errol Flynn, his tact and confidence made Blanca Rosa easily let her guard down. Therefore, displaying confidence can hasten the process of seduction.
