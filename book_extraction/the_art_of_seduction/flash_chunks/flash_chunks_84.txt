Term: Victim Theory
Definition: This theory states that every individual carries a sense of incompleteness or a gap in their character. In love, individuals are naturally attracted to those who can fill this gap. This process often operates on an unconscious level, relying on chance encounters. Seducers, however, utilize the awareness of such deficiencies to manipulate others effectively.

Term: 18 Types of Victims
Definition: These are the different types of individuals, each characterized by a dominant lack or deficiency which they're unconsciously seeking to fill. Although an individual might exhibit several types, there's generally a common need that binds them. 

Term: Social Exterior 
Definition: This refers to the outward presentation an individual uses to mask their inner deficiencies and weaknesses. This exterior may often be deceptive, projecting a personality at variance with the person's interior reality.

Term: Seduction and Identifying Victim Type 
Definition: Successful seduction requires accurately identifying the type of victim, understanding their needs and lacks, and responding appropriately to them. Mistaking someone's needs based on one's own deficiencies or assuming they share one's own desires can be counterproductive.

Term: Repulsion of Similar Types
Definition: The theory suggests that trying to seduce someone of one's own type is likely to be unsuccessful, as similarities do not fill the existing gaps but rather highlight them further. Two puzzles missing the same parts cannot complete each other.
