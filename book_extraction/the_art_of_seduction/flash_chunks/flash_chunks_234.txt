Term: Idealization in romantic relationships
Definition: The notion that when we fall in love or are enamored by another person, we often see a reflection of ourselves in them. If we perceive that person as deficient or ordinary, it could reflect negatively on us, and to protect our own self-esteem, we tend to idealize and overvalue the person we are involved with.

Term: The seducer's task
Definition: As a seducer, one should seize the opportunity to let people fantasize about them. Avoid overexposing and presenting one's true self to maintain an aura of mystery and allure. Being ordinary or limited should be avoided; instead, embrace the poetic possibilities, which can even include danger, naughtiness, and vulgarity, based on the tastes of the target.

Term: Stendhal's "crystallization"
Definition: This is the phenomenon of idealizing the image of a loved one in our minds. This happens twice, first upon meeting the person, and the second, more important crystallization, occurs when a bit of doubt enters the relationship, causing our imaginations to work double-time and deepen the idealization process.

Term: The role of doubt in relationships
Definition: A hint of uncertainty in a relationship can spark the imagination to believe there is something special, lofty, and unattainable about the other person, leading to a sort of "crystallization" of their image in one's mind. This can be beneficial in a seduction as it creates a sense of value in the relationship.

Term: Association with mythic and poetic imagery
Definition: In the process of seduction, it can be beneficial to subtly associate one's image with something mythic or grand. This could be achieved through clothes, words, or chosen environments. Such associations are particularly effective once the target is under the spell of the seducer and is susceptible to suggestion.

Term: Shared moments of exuberance
Definition: Heightened experiences, be it artistic, spiritual or sentimental associations, that lingers in the mind much longer than normal ones. Sharing these experiences with the target can be a powerful tool for seduction as they associate these elevated feelings with you. 

Term: Absence in the crystallization process
Definition: A prolonged absence too early in a seduction can be detrimental to the crystallization process, as the poetization process requires a sufficient amount of interaction and shared moments before it can sustain itself in absence.
