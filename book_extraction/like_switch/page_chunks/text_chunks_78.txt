SPLIT RELATIONSHIPS

interested in the other person but the other person is not interested in them is
not hard to spot. e interested person displays all the nonverbal cues present

displaying negative nonverbal cues (foe signals).

spend a long time in each other’s company are conﬁdent that the other person
is committed to the relationship. ey don’t need constant reminders. ey are

ese same observational relationship evaluations can be made with
businesspeople making deals, people trying to pick someone up, or just friends
out for a casual meal or drink. e point of people-watching is to sharpen your
observation skills, allowing you to become more aware of how people naturally
interact with one another and enhance your ability to accurately interpret what
you see. If you practice enough, your observations and skills in evaluating
human behavior will become automatic, thus making you a more eﬀective
communicator.
