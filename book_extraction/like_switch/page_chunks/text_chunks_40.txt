conscious eﬀort to cant their heads to one side or the other when approaching
women or else they may be perceived as predators. In such cases, you might be
a “heads up” guy and your intensions may be friendly, but your actions will
cause women to go “on the defensive” and make meaningful contact diﬃcult,
if not impossible, to achieve.
It seems that the head tilt has universal “friend” appeal throughout the animal kingdom.
THE SMILE
A smile is a powerful “friend” signal. Smiling faces are judged to be more
attractive, more likable, and less dominant. A smile portrays conﬁdence,
happiness, and enthusiasm and, most important, signals acceptance. A smile
telegraphs friendliness and increases the attractiveness of the person who is
smiling. e mere act of smiling will put people in a better, more receptive
mood. For the most part, people smile at individuals they like and do not
smile at those they do not like.
A smile releases endorphins, which give us a sense of well-being. When we
smile at other people, it is very diﬃcult for them not to smile back. is return
smile causes the target of your smile to feel good about themselves, and, as we
will learn in a later chapter, if you make people feel good about themselves,
they will like you.
e only problem with the smile is what scientists and observant members
of the general population have long recognized: ere is the “real” or “genuine”
smile and then there is the “fake” or “forced” smile. e “real” smile is used
around people we really want to make contact with or already know and like.
e fake smile, on the other hand, is often used when we are forced by social
obligation or the requirements of our job to appear friendly toward another
individual or group.
