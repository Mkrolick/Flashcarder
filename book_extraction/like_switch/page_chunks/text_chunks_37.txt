A head tilt is a strong friend signal. People who tilt their heads when they
interact with others are seen as more trustworthy and more attractive. Women
see men who approach them with their head slightly canted to one side or the
other as more handsome. Likewise, men see women who tilt their heads as
more attractive. Furthermore, people who tilt their heads toward the person
they are talking with are seen as more friendly, kind, and honest as compared
with individuals whose heads remain upright when they talk.
