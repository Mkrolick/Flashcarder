Another technique to “read a person’s mind” is to watch for a lip bite. A lip
bite is the soft biting or tugging of the upper or lower lip with the teeth. is
nonverbal gesture indicates that the person has something to say but is hesitant
to say it, for myriad reasons. Hence the old adage “Bite your lip,” meaning
keep your mouth shut and don’t say anything has validity. I often see lip biting
when I lecture. I’ll take it as a signal to construct an empathic statement such
as “It looks like you want to add something to the conversation,” to encourage
the students to express themselves. Most students are surprised that I can read
their minds and they feel good about themselves because I’m paying attention
to them.
LIP COMPRESSION
Lip compression has a similar meaning to the lip bite, but it has a more
negative connotation. A lip compression occurs when the upper and lower lips
are tightly pressed together. e lip compression indicates that the person you
are talking to has something to say but is reluctant to do so. Right before
suspects confess, I often saw a lip compression. e suspects wanted to say
something but they pressed their lips together to prevent the words from
coming out.

LIP TOUCHING
Self-touching of the lips with hands, ﬁngers, or objects such as pencils and
other inanimate objects indicates the person is feeling uneasy about the topic
that is being discussed. Stimulating the lips momentarily draws your attention
away from the sensitive topic and thus reduces anxiety. Suspects would often
unwittingly signal to me that the question I just asked exposed a sensitive topic
or made them feel uncomfortable. Seeing this silent cue, I would construct an
empathic statement such as “You seem a bit uncomfortable talking about this
topic,” to further explore the topic. e suspect would either conﬁrm or deny
that they were uncomfortable and, in most cases, provide reasons for feeling
the way they did.
