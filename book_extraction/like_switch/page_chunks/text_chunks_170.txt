BARRIERS
A good way to test for rapport is to look for barriers that individuals place
and/or remove between themselves and other people. People who do not feel
comfortable with other individuals will erect barriers or leave ones already
there in place. On the other hand, individuals who feel at ease with the person
with whom they are interacting will keep an open space between them, even if
it involves removing barriers that are already between them.
Attempts to block the body or chest are a foe signal. You can send this
nonverbal message at the dinner table by placing or leaving a centerpiece
between yourself and the individual sitting across from you.
Barriers can be formed by the positioning of hands and feet or placing an
inanimate object between individuals. Some of the nonverbal behaviors and
inanimate objects that create barriers are listed below. When you see these
kinds of barriers, you can assume that good rapport has not been established
between the individuals involved.
Arm crossing provides a barrier. (The backward lean demonstrates a lack of rapport.)
ARM CROSSING
Arm crossing serves as a psychological barrier to protect individuals from
topics that cause them psychological anxiety. People who are in good rapport
do not feel threatened, nor do they feel anxious. If the person you are talking
to suddenly crosses his or her arms, then rapport has not yet been established
or it signals weakening rapport. People who feel uncomfortable with the
person they are talking to or the topic being discussed tend to cross their arms
over their chest.
