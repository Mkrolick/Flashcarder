Term: Non-verbal cues 
Definition: These are non-verbal displays that can reveal thoughts or emotions. They can be obvious or subtle, with the latter being harder to control and revealing more intimate information. 

Term: Lip purse display 
Definition: This is a subtle non-verbal cue where there's a slight puckering or rounding of the lips, signaling dissension or disagreement. The more pronounced the lip purse, the more intense the disagreement. 

Term: Psychological principle of consistency
Definition: This principle states that once an opinion or decision is expressed out loud, changing a person's mind becomes more difficult due to the individual's tendency to remain consistent with their expressed stance. The desire to maintain consistency is because the decision-making process can cause tension, which dissipates after a decision is made. 

Term: Pursed Lips 
Definition: This non-verbal cue signals that a person disagrees or dissents with something. It can be used universally to understand others' opinions, particularly useful during conversations with spouse, colleagues, and friends. 

Term: Mind reading through observation 
Definition: Although we can't literally read minds, observing non-verbal cues, such as a pursed lip display, can give us insights into what a person is thinking. The aim is to leverage this understanding to try and change a person's mind before they articulate their opposition.
