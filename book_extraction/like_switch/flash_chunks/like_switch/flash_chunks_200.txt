Term: Eye Contact
Definition: A nonverbal signal that conveys a positive impression and is perceived as a potential friend signal. It should be established by holding a gaze for no longer than a second. Longer gaze may be perceived as aggression. The eye gaze is typically ended with a smile and if reciprocated, indicates interest.

Term: Extended Eye Gaze
Definition: A powerful rapport builder that implies longer than usual eye contact. This should not be mistaken with staring, which is perceived as a foe signal. Extended eye gaze can be used safely with strangers to intensify the emotional content of the friend signal, but should not be used to force premature intimacy.

Term: Pupil Dilation
Definition: A physical express of interest where the pupils, the black portion of the eyes, expand. This is a cue for positive attraction but it's value as a friend signal is limited due to the difficulty to spot in everyday personal interactions. It can be noticeably in people with blue eyes or artificially induced like Cleopatra did to appear more sensual.

Term: Using Friend Signals for Confession
Definition: Using friend signals like a non-threatening environment and quick rapport building to obtain consent in sensitive cases. This technique is particularly used when immediate arrest is not an option due to lack of probable cause, such as in case of suspected child molesters.
