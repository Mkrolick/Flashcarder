Term: Extroversion
Definition: A pervasive personality type characterized by gregariousness and self-confidence. Extroverts get their energy from being with other people, seek stimulation from their environments, often speak spontaneously without thinking, use a trial-and-error method to make decisions, maintain many relationships of relatively shallow depth, and use stream of consciousness to communicate. They are typically more outgoing in unfamiliar social situations.

Term: Introversion
Definition: Another pervasive personality type characterized by inward focus and thoughtful behavior. Introverts expend energy when socially engaged and require alone time to recharge. They tend to process internally, seldom speak without thinking, carefully weigh options before making decisions, maintain few relationships but with greater depth, and generally feel uncomfortable in large groups of unfamiliar people. They can become as outgoing as extroverts when comfortable with the surroundings. 

Term: Determining Extroversion/Introversion
Definition: One method to identify extroverts or gauge the comfort level of introverts is to begin a sentence and pause. Extroverts often complete the sentence, while introverts do not, unless they are comfortable with the people they are with.

Term: Personality and Purchases
Definition: The suggestion that a salesperson should consider whether a customer is an extrovert or an introvert before making a sale. Depending on the identified personality type, different approaches will be needed. 

Term: Interrelation of Extroverts and Introverts
Definition: Differences arise in the interaction between introverts and extroverts which may cause disagreements. For example, introverts, who think before speaking, may feel embarrassed by the spontaneous comments of extroverts. An introvert dating an extrovert may seek a closer relationship, which extroverts may be less willing to commit to. 

Term: Extroverts in Unfamiliar Situations
Definition: Extroverts tend to be more outgoing and communicate freely, even when in the company of unfamiliar people.

Term: Introverts in Familiar Situations
Definition: When introverts are among friends or in familiar surroundings, they exhibit increased outgoing behavior comparable to that of extroverts. However, this is typically short-lived and followed by a need for alone time to recharge.
