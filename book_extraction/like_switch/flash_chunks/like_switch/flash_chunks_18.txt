Term: The Law of the Rocky Road

Term: The Law of Personality
Definition: This law recognises consistent behavioral patterns exhibited by an individual in their everyday behavior. These could be related to physical appearance, belief systems, or personality traits. Two pervasive personality types - extroversion and introversion, play significant roles in personal interactions and relationship developments.

Term: Extroverts
Definition: Extroverts are seen as being more attractive as they present themselves as gregarious and self-confident. They gain energy from being with other people and seek stimulation from their environments. They tend to speak spontaneously without thinking and use a trial-and-error method to arrive at decisions. They maintain multiple relationships, which tend to be less deep.

Term: Introverts
Definition: Introverts are individuals who expend energy when they engage socially and need alone time to recharge. They seek stimulation from within and seldom speak without thinking. They carefully weigh options before making decisions. They tend to have fewer relationships, but those relationships are characterized by greater depth. They are less likely to blurt out personal information spontaneously.
