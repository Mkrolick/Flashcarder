Use Physical Lures
Targets with active minds
are dangerous: if they see through your
manipulations, they may suddenly develop
doubts. Put their minds gently to rest, and waken
their dormant senses, by combining a nondefen-
sive attitude with a charged sexual presence.
While your cool, nonchalant air is calming
their minds and lowering their inhibitions,
your glances, voice, and bearing—oozing sex
and desire—are getting under their skin, agi-
tating their senses and raising their temperature.
Never force the physical; instead infect your targets
with heat, lure them into lust. Lead them into the
moment—an intensified present in which mo-
rality, judgment, and concern for the fu-
ture all melt away and the body
succumbs to pleasure.
