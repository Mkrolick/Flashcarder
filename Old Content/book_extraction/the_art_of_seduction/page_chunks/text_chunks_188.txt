160 â€¢ The Art of Seduction
The Floating Gender. All of us have a mix of the masculine and the
feminine in our characters, but most of us learn to develop and exhibit the
socially acceptable side while repressing the other. People of the Floating
Gender type feel that the separation of the sexes into such distinct genders
is a burden. They are sometimes thought to be repressed or latent homo-
sexuals, but this is a misunderstanding: they may well be heterosexual but
their masculine and feminine sides are in flux, and because this may dis-
comfit others if they show it, they learn to repress it, perhaps by going to
one extreme. They would actually love to be able to play with their gender,
to give full expression to both sides. Many people fall into this type without
its being obvious: a woman may have a masculine energy, a man a devel-
oped aesthetic side. Do not look for obvious signs, because these types
often go underground, keeping it under wraps. This makes them vulnera-
ble to a powerful seduction.
What Floating Gender types are really looking for is another person of
uncertain gender, their counterpart from the opposite sex. Show them that
in your presence and they can relax, express the repressed side of their char-
acter. If you have such proclivities, this is the one instance where it would
be best to seduce the same type of the opposite sex. Each person will stir
up repressed desires in the other and will suddenly have license to explore
all kinds of gender combinations, without fear of judgment. If you are not
of the Floating Gender, leave this type alone. You will only inhibit them
and create more discomfort.
