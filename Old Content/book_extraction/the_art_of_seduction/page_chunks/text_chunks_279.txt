Use the Demonic Power of Words
to Sow Confusion
It
is hard to make
people listen; they are consumed
with their own thoughts and desires, and
have little time for yours. The trick to making them
listen is to say what they want to hear, to fill their ears
with whatever is pleasant to them. This is the essence of seduc-
tive language. Inflame people's emotions with loaded phrases,
flatter them, comfort their insecurities, envelop them in fantasies,
sweet words, and promises, and not only will they listen to
you, they will lose their will to resist you. Keep your lan-
guage vague, letting them read into it what
they want. Use writing to stir up fantasies
and to create an idealized
portrait of your-
self.
