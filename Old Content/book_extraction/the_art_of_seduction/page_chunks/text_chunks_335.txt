Confuse Desire and Reality—The Perfect Illusion • 307
Symbol: Shangri-La. Everyone has a vision in their mind of a
perfect place where people are kind and noble, where their
dreams can be realized and their wishes fulfilled, where life
is full of adventure and romance. Lead the target on a
journey there, give them a glimpse of Shangri-
La through the mists on the mountain,
and they will fall in love.
Reversal
There is no reversal to this chapter. No seduction can proceed without
creating illusion, the sense of a world that is real but separate from
reality.
