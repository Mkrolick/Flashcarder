Appendix B
Soft Seduction: How to Sell
Anything to the Masses
The less you seem to be
selling something—including yourself—the better. By be-
ing too obvious in your pitch, you will raise suspicion; you will also bore
your audience, an unforgivable sin. Instead, make your approach soft, seductive, and
insidious. Soft: be indirect. Create news and events for the media to pick up, spreading your
name in a way that seems spontaneous, not hard or calculated. Seductive: keep it entertaining.
Your name and image are bathed in positive associations; you are selling pleasure and prom-
ise. Insidious: aim at the unconscious, using images that linger in the mind, placing
your message in the visuals. Frame what you are selling as part of a new
trend, and it will become one. It is almost impossible to
resist the soft seduction.
