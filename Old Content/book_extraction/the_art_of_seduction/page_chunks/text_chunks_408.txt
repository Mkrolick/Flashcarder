Phase Four
Moving In for the Kill
First you worked on their mind—the mental seduction. Then you
confused and stirred them up—the emotional seduction. Now the
time has come for hand-to-hand combat—the physical seduction.
At this point, your victims are weak and ripe with desire: by show-.
ing a little coldness or uninterest, you will spark panic—they will
come after you with impatience and erotic energy (21: Give them
space to fall—the pursuer is pursued). To bring them to a boil, you
need to put their minds to sleep and heat up their senses. It is best
to lure them into lust by sending certain loaded signals that will get
under their skin and spread sexual desire like a poison (22: Use
physical lures). The moment to strike and move in for the kill is
when your victim is brimming with desire, but not consciously ex-
pecting the climax to come (23: Master the art of the bold move).
Once the seduction is over, there is the danger that disenchant-
ment will set in and ruin all your hard work (24: Beware the
aftereffects). If you are after a relationship, then you must con-
stantly re-seduce the victim, creating tension and releasing it. If
your victim is to be sacrificed, then it must be done swiftly and
cleanly, leaving you free (physically and psychologically) to move
on to the next victim. Then the game begins all over.
