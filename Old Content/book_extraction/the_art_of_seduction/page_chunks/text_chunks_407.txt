Mix Pleasure with Pain • 379
Symbol: The Precipice. At the edge of a cliff, people often feel
lightheaded, both fearful and dizzy. For a moment they
can imagine themselves falling headlong. At the
same time, a part of them is tempted. Lead
your targets as close to the edge as
possible, then pull them
back. No thrill
without
fear.
Reversal
People who have recently experienced a lot of pain or a loss will flee if
you try to inflict more on them. They have enough in their lives al-
ready. Far better to surround these types with pleasure—that will put them
under your spell. The technique of inflicting pain works best on those who
have it easy, who have power and few problems. People with comfortable
lives may also feel a gnawing sense of guilt, as if they had gotten away with
something. They may not consciously know it, but secretly they long for
some punishment, a good mental thrashing, something that will bring
them back down to earth.
Also, remember to not use the pleasure-through-pain tactic too early
on. Some of the greatest seducers in history—Byron, Jiang Qing (Madame
Mao), Picasso—had a sadistic streak, an ability to inflict mental torture. If
their victims had known in advance what they were getting themselves
into, they would have run for the hills. In truth, most of these seducers
lured their targets into their webs by appearing to be paragons of sweetness
and affection. Even Byron seemed like an angel when he first met a
woman, so that she tended to doubt his devilish reputation—a seductive
doubt, for it allowed her to think of herself as the only one who really
understood him. His cruelty would come out later on, but by then it would
be too late. The victim's emotions were engaged, and his harshness would
only intensify her feelings.
In the beginning, then, wear the mask of a lamb, making pleasure and
attentiveness your bait. First get under their skin, then lead them on a wild
ride.
