Poeticize Your Presence
Important things happen when your targets
are alone: the slightest feeling of relief that
you are not there, and it is all over. Fa-
miliarity and overexposure will cause
this reaction. Remain elusive, then,
so that when you are away, they
will yearn to see you again, and
will associate you only with
pleasant thoughts. Occupy their
minds by alternating an excit-
ing presence with a cool dis-
tance, exuberant moments
followed by calculated absences.
Associate yourself with poetic
images and objects, so that when
they think of you, they begin to see
you through an idealized halo. The
more you figure in their minds, the
more they will envelop you in seductive
fantasies. Feed these fantasies by subtle
inconsistencies and changes in your behavior.
