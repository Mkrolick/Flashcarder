Phase One
Separation—
Stirring Interest and Desire
Your victims live in their own worlds, their minds occupied with
anxieties and daily concerns. Your goal in this initial phase is to
slowly separate them from that closed world and fill their minds
with thoughts of you. Once you have decided whom to seduce
(1: Choose the right victim), your first task is to get your vic-
tims' attention, to stir interest in you. For those who might be
more resistant or difficult, you should try a slower and more in-
sidious approach, first winning their friendship (2: Create a
false sense of security—approach indirectly); for those who are
bored and less difficult to reach, a more dramatic approach will
work, either fascinating them with a mysterious presence (3:
Send mixed signals) or seeming to be someone who is coveted
and fought over by others (4: Appear to be an object of desire).
Once the victim is properly intrigued, you need to transform
their interest into something stronger—desire. Desire is generally
preceded by feelings of emptiness, of something missing inside
that needs fulfillment. You must deliberately instill such feelings,
make your victims aware of the adventure and romance that are
lacking in their lives (5: Create a need—stir anxiety and dis-
content). If they see you as the one to fill their emptiness, inter-
est will blossom into desire. The desire should be stoked by
subtly planting ideas in their minds, hints of the seductive plea-
sures that await them (6: Master the art of insinuation). Mir-
roring your victims' values, indulging them in their wants and
moods will charm and delight them (7: Enter their spirit).
Without realizing how it has happened, more and more of their
thoughts now revolve around you. The time has come for some-
thing stronger. Lure them with an irresistible pleasure or adven-
ture (8: Create temptation) and they will follow your lead.
