Create a False Sense of Security-
Approach Indirectly
If you are too
direct early on, you risk stir-
ring up a resistance that will never be
lowered. At first there must be nothing of the
seducer in your manner. The seduction should begin
at an angle, indirectly, so that the target only gradually
becomes aware of you. Haunt the periphery of your target's
life—approach through a third party, or seem to cultivate a
relatively neutral relationship, moving gradually from friend to
lover. Arrange an occasional "chance" encounter, as if you and your
target were destined to become acquainted—nothing is more seductive
than a sense of destiny. Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike.
