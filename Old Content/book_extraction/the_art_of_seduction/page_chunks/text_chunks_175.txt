The Eighteen Types
The people around you are all potential victims of a
seduction, but first you must know what type of vic-
tim you are dealing with. Victims are categorized
by what they feel they are missing in lifeâ€”ad-
venture, attention, romance, a naughty expe-
rience, mental or physical stimulation, etc.
Once you identify their type, you have
the necessary ingredients for a seduc-
tion: you will be the one to give
them what they lack and cannot
get on their own. In studying
potential victims, learn to see
the reality behind the ap-
pearance. A timid person
may yearn to play the
star; a prude may
long for a trans-
gressive thrill.
Never try to
seduce your
own type.
