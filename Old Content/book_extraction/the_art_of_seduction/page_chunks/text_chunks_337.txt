Isolate the Victim
An iso-
lated person is weak.
By slowly isolating your vic-
tims, you make them more vul-
nerable to your influence. Their
isolation may be psychological: by filling
their field of vision through the pleasurable
attention you pay them, you crowd out every-
thing else in their mind. They see and think
only of you. The isolation may also be physi-
cal: you take them away from their normal mi-
lieu, friends, family, home. Give them the
sense of being marginalized, in limboâ€”they
are leaving one world behind and entering
another. Once isolated like this, they have
no outside support, and in their confu-
sion they are easily led astray.
Lure the seduced into your
lair, where nothing is
familiar.
