Beware the Aftereffects
Danger follows
in the aftermath of a successful se-
duction. After emotions have reached a pitch,
they often swing in the opposite direction—toward
lassitude, distrust, disappointment. Beware of the long,
drawn-out goodbye; insecure, the victim will cling and claw,
and both sides will suffer. If you are to part, make the sacrifice
swift and sudden. If necessary, deliberately break the spell you
have created. If you are to stay in a relationship, beware a flag-
ging of energy, a creeping familiarity that will spoil the
fantasy. If the game is to go on, a second seduction is
required. Never let the other person take you for
granted—use absence, create pain and con-
flict, to keep the seduced on ten-
terhooks.
