A
man is often
secretly oppressed by
the role he has to
playâ€”by always having to
be responsible, in control, and
rational. The Siren is the ulti-
mate male fantasy figure because
she offers a total release from the
limitations of his life. In her pres-
ence, which is always heightened and
sexually charged, the male feels
transported to a world of pure plea-
sure. She is dangerous, and in pursu-
ing her energetically the man can lose
control over himself something he
yearns to do. The Siren is a mirage;
she lures men by cultivating a par-
ticular appearance and manner.
In a world where women are
often too timid to project such
an image, learn to take
control of the male li-
bido by embodying
his fantasy.
