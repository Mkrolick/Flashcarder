Daily life is harsh, and most of us
constantly seek escape from it in fantasies and
dreams. Stars feed on this weakness; standing
out from others through a distinctive and appeal-
ing style, they make us want to watch them. At
the same time, they are vague and ethereal,
keeping their distance, and letting us imagine
more than is there. Their dreamlike quality
works on our unconscious; we are not even
aware how much we imitate them. Learn to be-
come an object of fascination by projecting the
glittering but elusive presence of the Star.
