Keep Them in Suspense-
What Comes Next?
The moment people feel they know what to expect from
you, your spell on them is broken. More: you have ceded
them power. The only way to lead the seduced along and
keep the upper hand is to create suspense, a calculated sur-
prise. People love a mystery, and this is the key to luring
them further into your web. Behave in a way that leaves
them wondering, What are you up to? Doing something
they do not expect from you will give them a delightful
sense of spontaneityâ€”they will not be able to fore-
see what comes next. You are always one step
ahead and in control. Give the victim a
thrill with a sudden change of
direction.
