Effect a Regression
People who
have experienced a certain kind of
pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive
it. The deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories
are usually those from earliest childhood, and are often un-
consciously associated with a parental figure. Bring your tar-
gets back to that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle
and positioning them as the needy child. Unaware of the cause of
their emotional response, they will fall in love with you. Alterna-
tively, you too can regress, letting them play the role of the pro-
tecting, nursing parent. In either case you are offering the
ultimate fantasy: the chance to have an intimate rela-
tionship with mommy or daddy, son or daughter.
