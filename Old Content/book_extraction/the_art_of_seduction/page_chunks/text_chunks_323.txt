Confuse Desire and Realityâ€”
The Perfect Illusion
To
compensate for the difficulties in their
lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imag-
ining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. If you can
create the illusion that through you they can live out their
dreams, you will have them at your mercy. It is im-
portant to start slowly, gaining their trust,
and gradually constructing the fantasy
that matches their desires. Aim at
secret wishes that have been thwarted
or repressed, stirring up uncontrollable
emotions, clouding their powers of reason. The
perfect illusion is one that does not depart too much from
reality, but has a touch of the unreal to it, like a waking dream,
head the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can
no longer tell the difference between illusion
and reality.
