202 • The Art of Seduction
and discipline—precisely what no other leader had at the time. In the
American presidential race of 1980, the irresoluteness of Jimmy Carter
made the single-mindedness of Ronald Reagan look desirable. Contrasts
are eminently seductive because they do not depend on your own words or
self-advertisements. The public reads them unconsciously, and sees what it
wants to see.
Finally, appearing to be desired by others will raise your value, but often
how you carry yourself can influence this as well. Do not let your targets
see you so often; keep your distance, seem unattainable, out of their reach.
An object that is rare and hard to obtain is generally more prized.
Symbol: The Trophy.
What makes you want to win the trophy, and to see it as
something worth having, is the sight of the other competitors. Some,
out of a spirit of kindness, may want to reward everyone for trying, but
the Trophy then loses its value. It must represent not only
your victory but everyone else's defeat.
Reversal
There is no reversal. It is essential to appear desirable in the eyes of
others.
Create a Need—
Stir Anxiety and Discontent
A perfectly satisfied
person cannot be seduced. Tension and
disharmony must be instilled in your targets' minds. Stir
within them feelings of discontent, an unhappiness with their
circumstances and with themselves: their life lacks adventure, they
have strayed from the ideals of their youth, they have become boring.
The feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to in-
sinuate yourself, to make them see you as the answer to their
problems. Pain and anxiety are the proper precursors to
pleasure. Learn to manufacture the need
that you can fill.
