Term: Complexity and Power
Definition: The mixture of both masculine and feminine qualities, or a combination of other contrasting aspects, brings complexity to a person's persona and can be empowering. This mix of attributes can create depth and mystery which can be seductive.

Term: The Paradox of Gender Roles
Definition: The juxtaposition of femininity and masculinity is a powerful strategy in seduction. This can play out as a feminine man or a masculine woman, but it is most effective when the secondary quality is subtly hinted at rather than being pronounced.

Term: Physical Heat and Emotional Coldness
Definition: Combining a physically attractive appearance with an emotionally cold demeanor can be a seductive strategy. It creates intrigue and incites people to invest time and emotion trying to break through the emotional distance, keeping them hooked.

Term: The Role of Ambiguity and Mystery 
Definition: Being elusive or vague adds more intrigue, compelling people to keep thinking about someone long after initial interactions. Speaking little or only covering surface-level conversations can hint at deeper, unrevealed aspects of one's persona, keeping people's attention held. 

Term: Intriguing Paradox
Definition: The strategy of presenting oneself in two contradicting manners is powerful in seduction when the underquality is merely hinted at. If the mix is too striking, it can seem bizarre or threatening instead of intriguing.
