Term: Disenchantment
Definition: The emotional course one experiences following the climax of seduction, often accompanied by feelings of disappointment or disgust due to the fall in tension and excitement. This can happen to both the seducer and the seduced, as they face the reality of each other's flaws as opposed to the idealized versions during the act of seduction. 

Term: Second Seduction
Definition: An attempt to rekindle the passion and enchantment within a relationship following the initial phase of disenchantment. This requires mastering the art of post-seduction to mitigate undesired effects and to keep the relationship from falling into comfort and routine.

Term: Inertia in Seduction
Definition: The tendency to reduce efforts in maintaining the state of enchantment after the act of seduction is complete. This can lead to the victim feeling taken for granted resulting in their disenchantment. 

Term: Fight against Inertia
Definition: The conscious effort made to consistently show that the act of seduction isn't over after the first successful act, which includes focusing on the victims and continuously courting them in order to prevent the settling into comfort and routine.  

Term: Monotonous Temperament
Definition: A constant temperament that lacks variety and can result in satiation and disgust in the context of seduction, as it deprives the other of the pleasure that comes with the unpredictability and vivacity in an affair of the heart. 

Term: Enchanting Variety
Definition: The presence of different emotions within a relationship such as restlessness, jealousy, quarrels and making friends again. In a seductive setting, these ups and downs can serve as the food for love as they prevent uniformity and staleness from setting in.

Term: Uniformity in Love
Definition: The presence of constant peace and method in a romantic relationship that leads to ennui, languor, weariness and ultimate disgust, causing the passion to disappear. This term is closely related to disenchantment in the post-seduction phase.
