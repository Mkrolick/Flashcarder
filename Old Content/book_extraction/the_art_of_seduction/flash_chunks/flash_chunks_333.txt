Term: Siren
Definition: In the context of seduction, a Siren is a woman who distinguishes herself from others through intensely feminine and sexual presence, and proficiently masters the art of making men lose control over their rationality, enticing them toward danger and irrationality. This seductive power can transform even the most potent men into childish slaves.

Term: Elusiveness
Definition: A seductive quality used by a Siren, characterized by being slightly elusive and distant, creating a living fantasy that leaves men vehemently chasing, thinking that they're acting on their initiative even though they are being manipulated deeply.

Term: Danger 
Definition: A seductive element that is critical to the effectiveness of a Siren's allure. The apparent risk, challenge, or in extreme cases, the potential threat of death, adds an emotional spice to the seduction, and it is particularly appealing to men who are normally rational.

Term: Physicality 
Definition: Preeminent in Siren-type seduction, physicality might refer to a scent, heightened femininity evoked through makeup and clothing, or other physical traits that act powerfully on men because they tend to bypass rational processes like a decoy on an animal.

Term: Voice 
Definition: An important quality characteristic of a Siren, with an immediate animal presence with incredible suggestive power. The ability of the mother's voice to conquer the child, the soothing voice of a lover, whispering sweet nothings, lulling words of comfort, it all potentially has a regressive and compelling effect.
   
Term: Intellectuals 
Definition: Referred to as a group most susceptible to the Siren call of pure physical pleasure, primarily because their lives lack it. The Siren doesn't need to worry about finding the right victim as it's said to work on all types, including intellectuals.
