Term: The Siren
Definition: The Siren is an ancient prototype of a seductress, embodying a male fantasy of a highly sexual, supremely confident, alluring female offering pleasure and a hint of danger. She operates on a man's most basic emotions and can transform a normally strong and responsible male into a child-like slave.

Term: Siren's Qualities

Term: The Siren's Physicality
Definition: Physicality is of utmost importance in categorizing a woman as a Siren. This includes a highly feminine and sexual presence, to the point of near exaggeration. Most women lack the confidence to project such an image, making a Siren's physicality her unique defining feature.

Term: The Siren's Method

Term: Required Attributes for a Sex Siren
Definition: A woman does not have to be born with the attributes of a Sex Siren. Most of the physical elements are a construction; she just needs to have an air of schoolgirl innocence. Her walk, voice, and manner should be delightfully ambiguous, seeming both experienced and naive.
