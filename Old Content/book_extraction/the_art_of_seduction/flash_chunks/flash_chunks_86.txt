Term: The Reformed Rake or Siren
Definition: This character type refers to previous seducers who have been forced to abandon their ways due to various reasons (e.g. engaging in a relationship, social pressure, ageing). They tend to recall their past with resentment and longing for the pleasures they once experienced. It's essential to let them believe they are doing the seduction while sparking their interest indirectly. Also, beware that by sparking the old feeling gives you power, but then you have to live with the unpredictable habits of this character.

Term: The Disappointed Dreamer
Definition: This character type refers to people who have spent a lot of time alone growing up and developed a powerful fantasy life. As they grow up, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to reconcile their fantasy life with their reality resulting in constant disappointment, especially in relationships. They are bitter and yearning for something grand and romantic. A successful seduction involves disguising less favorable qualities and offering a fragment of their dream while preventing reality from breaking the illusion.

Term: The Pampered Royal
Definition: These types were spoiled as children, having all their desires fulfilled. They then grow up expecting others to entertain them, leading to boredom and restlessness. They tend to jump from one person, job, or place to another in search of variety to avoid boredom. However, what they are truly looking for is someone who can pamper them like their parents did. To seduce, one must offer variety, maintain mystery, and surprise. 

Term: The New Prude
Definition: This character type represents individuals overly concerned about what society deems appropriate. They harbor a fear of feeling or appearing ridiculous. They're known to have an excessive need for approval and a lack of spontaneity. They're often hard workers, reliable, and moral but their over-concerned nature makes them vulnerable as their desire to appear rebellious or spontaneous can be exploited.
