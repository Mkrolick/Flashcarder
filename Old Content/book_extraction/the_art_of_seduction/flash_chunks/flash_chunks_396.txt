Term: Reversal
Definition: The act of ensuring enchantment of a person by re-seducing them constantly, but allowing a little familiarity to creep in. The target should feel like they are getting to know you, however not too much, too much mystery can create doubt. The main goal is not to remain completely unfamiliar but to occasionally surprise the target, giving them the feeling of discovering new aspects about you.
