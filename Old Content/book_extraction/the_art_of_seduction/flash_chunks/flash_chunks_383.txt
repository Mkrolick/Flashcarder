Term: Seduction 
Definition: Seduction is viewed as a type of enchantment where one party strategically draws in and enthralls the other, creating an aura of mystery and suspense. This process often involves playing different roles and concealing personal flaws to maintain the allure.

Term: Disenchantment 
Definition: Disenchantment sets in after the completion of the seduction, and is characterized by a release of tension, a possible feeling letdown, or even disgust. This is a natural emotional course that can be likened to the wearing off of a drug, revealing the realities that were masked during the seduction.

Term: Post-Seduction Tactics 
Definition: Post-Seduction tactics refer to ways of preventing or mitigating the undesired after-effects of disenchantment. These include fighting against inertia by continuously proving oneself, maintaining mystery and not revealing everything to the target, keeping the interaction light, playful and avoid being too serious or whiny, and avoiding slow burnout by decisively ending things when they are over.

Term: Familiarity 
Definition: Familiarity in the context of seduction refers to the target knowing everything about you, leading to comfort but potentially loss of mystery and fantasy. If familiarity settles in, it could lead to disenchantment as erotic tension might dissolve.

Term: Inertia in Seduction 
Definition: Inertia in seduction refers to a state of complacency, where one party puts in less effort after the seduction stage. This is often taken negatively by the other party and could lead to feelings of being taken for granted.

Term: Anti-Seductive Behavior 
Definition: Anti-seductive behaviors are actions that are likely to lead to disenchantment or ruin the seductive allure. This might include taking things too seriously, becoming nagging and complaining, revealing too much about oneself, or not being proactive in maintaining the excitement and effort put into during seduction. 

Term: Sacrifice and Integration
Definition: In the context of seduction, sacrifice refers to the commitment to cease the relationship, while integration refers to the continuation and maintenance of the relationship. It is necessary to consider post-seduction disenchantment in either direction.
