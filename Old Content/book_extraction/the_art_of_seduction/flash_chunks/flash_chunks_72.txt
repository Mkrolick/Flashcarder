Term: The Anti-Seducer
Definition: Often seen as a character who either pays too little attention or too much forward attention to their object of interest. Insensitivity, inattentiveness, and self-absorption can be common traits of an anti-seducer. They may neglect important details or signals given by another person. Additionally, an anti-seducer may also show conceit, assuming that their object of interest cannot possibly resist them, which is regarded as highly anti-seductive.

Term: Seduction
Definition: A ritualistic process involving detailed attention to the object of one's affection and patience in securing their interest.
