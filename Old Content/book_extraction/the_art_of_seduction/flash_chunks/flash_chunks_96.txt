Term: The Sensualist
Definition: Sensualists are marked by their overactive senses, and are extremely responsive to their environment. They appreciate detail, spectacle, beauty and physical lures.

Term: The Lonely Leader
Definition: Lonely Leaders are individuals who hold positions of power and, as a result, are treated differently from everyone else. They tend to be suspicious, distrustful, and hard-edged due their experience with others wanting something from them. Despite this, they long to be seduced or overwhelmed. Act as their equal or superior, blunt honesty can impress them and such personalities can be made emotional through pain followed by demonstrated tenderness.

Term: The Floating Gender
