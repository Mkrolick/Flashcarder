Lip Compression
LIP TOUCHING
Self-touching of the lips with hands, ﬁngers, or objects such as pencils and
other inanimate objects indicates the person is feeling uneasy about the topic
that is being discussed. Stimulating the lips momentarily draws your attention
away from the sensitive topic and thus reduces anxiety. Suspects would often
unwittingly signal to me that the question I just asked exposed a sensitive topic
or made them feel uncomfortable. Seeing this silent cue, I would construct an
empathic statement such as “You seem a bit uncomfortable talking about this
topic,” to further explore the topic. e suspect would either conﬁrm or deny
that they were uncomfortable and, in most cases, provide reasons for feeling
the way they did.
Lip touching demonstrates that the person is feeling uneasy or uncomfortable.
is self-touching signal can be eﬀectively used in business and social
settings. For example, if you are in a one-to-one sales meeting presenting a new
product and you see your client lightly rubbing his lips with his ﬁngers, take
note. Upon seeing this nonverbal cue, you should formulate an empathic
statement such as “is may be a bit overwhelming because you have never
used this product before” to allow the client to express any concerns or
misgivings they might have about the product or service you are oﬀering. Once
you have identiﬁed your client’s speciﬁc concerns you can adapt your sales
presentation to more eﬀectively sell your product or service.
In social settings, you can avoid embarrassing moments by observing the
person you are talking to. If you introduce a sensitive topic and you see the
other person pursing or compressing their lips, you are best advised to change
the subject before more damage is done. You can safely return to the subject
when suﬃcient rapport has been built between you and the other person.
