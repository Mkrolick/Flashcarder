will learn in a later chapter, if you make people feel good about themselves,
they will like you.
e only problem with the smile is what scientists and observant members
of the general population have long recognized: ere is the “real” or “genuine”
smile and then there is the “fake” or “forced” smile. e “real” smile is used
around people we really want to make contact with or already know and like.
e fake smile, on the other hand, is often used when we are forced by social
obligation or the requirements of our job to appear friendly toward another
individual or group.

Can you tell which smile is the “real” smile and which one is “fake”? If you can’t, don’t de-spair. Actually, they’re
both real smiles!
If you want people to like you, your smiles should be genuine. e telltale
signs of a genuine smile are the upturned corners of the mouth and upward
movement of the cheeks accompanied by wrinkling around the edges of the
eyes. As opposed to sincere smiles, forced smiles tend to be lopsided. For right-
handed people a forced smile tends to be stronger on the right side of the face,
and for left-handed people, it tends to be stronger on the left. Fake smiles also
lack synchrony. ey begin later than real smiles and taper oﬀ in an irregular
manner. With a real smile, the cheeks are raised, bagged skin forms under the
eyes, crow’s feet appear around the corners of the eyes, and with some
individuals, the nose may dip downward. In a fake smile, you can see that the
corners of the mouth are not upturned and the cheeks are not uplifted to cause
wrinkling around the eyes, the telltale sign of a genuine smile. Wrinkling
around the eyes is often diﬃcult to see in young people, whose skin is more
elastic than older folks. Nonetheless, our brains can spot the diﬀerence
between a real smile and a fake smile.
