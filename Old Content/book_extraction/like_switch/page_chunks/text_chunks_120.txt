through verbal communication, let it be this: e more you can encourage the
other person to speak, the more you listen to what they say, display empathy, and
respond positively when reacting to their comments, the greater the likelihood that
person will feel good about themselves (Golden Rule of Friendship) and like you as
a result. is means that when I (“ME”) desire YOU as a friend, I want to let
you know I am interested in what you have to say, and, in addition, give you
plenty of time to say it.
