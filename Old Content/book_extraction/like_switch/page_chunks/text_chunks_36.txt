THE HEAD TILT
A head tilt to the right or to the left is a nonthreatening gesture. e tilted
head exposes one of the carotid arteries, which are positioned on either side of
the neck. e carotid arteries are the pathways that supply the brain with
oxygenated blood. Severing either carotid artery causes death within minutes.
People who feel threatened protect their carotid arteries by tucking their neck
into their shoulders. People expose their carotid arteries when they meet people
who do not pose a threat.
