A natural eyebrow ﬂash. In real-life situations, it doesn’t appear so exaggerated because it occurs very
quickly . . . thus the term eyebrow ﬂash.
If you are still interested in meeting someone who doesn’t reciprocate your
eyebrow ﬂash, it doesn’t guarantee that person is “oﬀ-limits” but you might
want to use (and look for) other friend signals before you decide to actually try
to meet that individual.
“Friendly” eyebrow ﬂashes involve brief eye contact with other persons,
particularly if you don’t know the person or are a passing acquaintance.
Prolonged eye contact between two people indicates intense emotion, and is
either an act of love or hostility. Prolonged eye contact (“staring”) is so
disturbing that in normal social encounters we avoid eye contact lasting more
than a second or two. Among a crowd of strangers in a public setting, eye
contact will generally last only a fraction of a second, and most people will
avoid making any eye contact at all.
Not all eyebrow ﬂashes are friend signals. An example of an “unnatural”
eyebrow ﬂash is pictured on the next page. In real time, an unnatural eyebrow
ﬂash occurs when a person displays an eyebrow ﬂash with extended “hang
time” of the upward movement of the eyebrows. An unnatural eyebrow ﬂash
will be perceived as unfriendly at best and creepy at worst. If you see or display
an unnatural eyebrow ﬂash, it will be perceived as a foe signal and, like the
urban scowl, will not be conducive to social interaction or making friends.
