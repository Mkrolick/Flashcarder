SMILES FOR EFFECT
e way you smile will inﬂuence the way people perceive you and encourage
or discourage friendship formation. Women in particular often use smiles to
regulate the initiation of ﬁrst encounters and to set the pace of the subsequent
personal interactions. Men more readily approach women who smile at them.
A sincere smile gives men permission to approach. A forced smile or no smile
at all sends the message that a woman is not interested in a man’s overtures.
Likewise, a woman can send the message that she is open to male approaches
by regulating the frequency and intensity of her smile, in conjunction with
other friend signals.
Learning how to produce a “real” smile at will, particularly when you don’t
feel in the mood to display it, takes practice. Study the pictures in the book
and think about smiles you have seen in your everyday life. en stand in front
of a mirror and actually produce fake and real smiles. It won’t be that diﬃcult.
Just think about the times you have genuinely wanted to show appreciation to
someone you loved or were forced to smile at some unwanted houseguest at a
family dinner or at an obnoxious business associate. Practice the real smile
until it becomes automatic.  en you can choose to use it when you wish.
