the young man has already sipped from his cup. In the third snapshot, the
woman has ﬁnished her drink and placed it to one side, leaving an open space
between herself and the young man, who is still holding his cup but is clearly
about to place it on the other side of the table to clear the space between them
of any barriers.
Barrier-removing behaviors between you and the person you are talking to
signal good rapport. You can monitor rapport during conversations by
watching where people place their cups or other objects on the table. If the
person you are talking to unexpectedly places their cup in front of you, then
this gesture could signal weakening rapport. In other words, cup or object
positioning can serve as a barometer of rapport to signal whether it is
dissipating or increasing. is is seen in the series of photos that follows on
page 180.
In the ﬁrst photo, we see a couple seated at a table with a vase of ﬂowers
between them. In the next two photos, we see the young man removing the
barrier (ﬂowers) between himself and the young lady by picking up the vase
and placing it on the side. e fourth photo shows increasing rapport with no
barrier, and the young couple leaning in toward each other, displaying head
tilts and smiling. e ﬁfth picture displays still stronger rapport, as the male
and female are now holding hands. e sixth picture captures the strongest
rapport of all, as the young man is whispering to his companion, whispering
being another strong sign of good rapport.
