test your rapport with the other person by using the lead-and-follow
technique. Heretofore, you have been mirroring the other person. Now you
want to see if they mirror your gestures, signaling rapport. Change your body
position. If you have established rapport, the other person should mirror you
within twenty to thirty seconds.
In the lead-and-follow approach to testing for rapport, you are changing
your body position by crossing or uncrossing your arms and legs or making
some other obvious change in your posture. If the other person mirrors the
same gesture, rapport has been established. However, if the other person does
not respond in like kind, then you have the option of continuing to build
rapport, followed by a new lead-and-follow test to see if rapport has been
established after your additional eﬀorts have been expended.
HAIR FLIP
A head toss accompanied by a momentary ﬂip of the hair with the hand is an
indicator of rapport.
e key nonverbal display during a hair ﬂip is mutual gaze, which is a
strong positive sign that rapport has been established. e three pictures that
follow show a “hair ﬂip” in sequence, as it would actually appear in real time.
Observe the hair ﬂip carefully when testing for rapport. is is because a
hair ﬂip, without mutual gaze, that is, a hair ﬂip accompanied by broken eye
contact, is a strong negative signal indicating a lack of rapport. is gesture is
commonly referred to as a “bitch ﬂip.”
