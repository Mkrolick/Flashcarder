People who are about to attack telegraph nonverbal signals such as clenching
their ﬁsts and widening their stance for stability. A wide stance lowers the
body’s center of gravity in preparation for a ﬁght. A wide stance with arms
akimbo (hands on hips) signals dominance. Arms akimbo widens a person’s
proﬁle in an attempt to display dominance. Oftentimes, an angry person’s
nostrils “ﬂare” (widen) in an attempt to enhance oxygen intake. ey are also
likely to give anger signs such as redness of the face. Obviously, these foe
signals alert the scanning brain to potential danger and prepare the recipient of
these attack signals for the “ﬁght or ﬂight” response, hardly a prelude to a
positive friendship.

INSULTING GESTURES
Numerous gestures are oﬀensive to others and antithetical to developing good
relationships. Some of them are almost universally recognized: for example, the
upraised middle ﬁnger. It is doubtful anyone intent on establishing a positive
interaction with another person would transmit this gesture. e problem is
that certain gestures that are “harmless” (have no negative connotation) in one
culture might be highly oﬀensive in another. Just as the same words have
diﬀerent meanings across diﬀerent cultures, so, too, do nonverbal
communications. If you note that somebody reacts negatively toward you for
no “apparent” reason you might want to consider if any gesture you just made
might have been perceived as oﬀensive to them.
SCRUNCHED NOSE
Like other foe signals, a scrunched nose makes anyone observing it less likely
to see you in a positive light and less open to any further overtures you send
their way.
