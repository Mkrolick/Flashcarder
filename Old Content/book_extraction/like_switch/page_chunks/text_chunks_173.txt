Anxious people will signify their uneasiness by prolonged eye closure. eir
eyelids serve as a barrier to prevent them from seeing the person or thing that
makes them anxious or uncomfortable. On several occasions when I entered
my boss’s oﬃce I saw him close his eyelids for one to two seconds. is display
