Furrowed eyebrows
FACIAL TENSION
Tightened jaw muscles, narrowing of the eyes, and furrowed eyebrows are a
cluster of nonverbal foe signals that can be seen from a distance and serve as
early warning indicators to alert you to the possibility that the person you are
about to meet may pose a threat. Displaying foe signals makes meaningful
communication diﬃcult, especially in new relationships. Facial tension can be
easily misinterpreted because people often carry over tensions from their jobs
or home lives to social situations, causing new friends or even old ones to take
note and become unnecessarily guarded and apprehensive.
AGGRESSIVE STANCE
A wide stance with arms akimbo (hands on hips) is a foe signal. A wide stance

Arms akimbo widens a person’s proﬁle in an attempt to display dominance.
ATTACK SIGNALS
People who are about to attack telegraph nonverbal signals such as clenching

body’s center of gravity in preparation for a ﬁght. A wide stance with arms
akimbo (hands on hips) signals dominance. Arms akimbo widens a person’s
proﬁle in an attempt to display dominance. Oftentimes, an angry person’s
nostrils “ﬂare” (widen) in an attempt to enhance oxygen intake. ey are also
likely to give anger signs such as redness of the face. Obviously, these foe
signals alert the scanning brain to potential danger and prepare the recipient of
these attack signals for the “ﬁght or ﬂight” response, hardly a prelude to a
positive friendship.

relationships. Some of them are almost universally recognized: for example, the
