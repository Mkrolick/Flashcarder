NURTURING AND SUSTAINING LONG- TERM
RELATIONSHIPS
People don’t care about how much you know until they ﬁrst know how much you care.
—ZIG ZIGLAR
All long-term relationships start out as short-term relationships and develop
the same way as all friendships do, through an understanding and utilization of
all the tools for building and sustaining rapport. As time passes, some of our
relationships grow from friendship to romantic. When a relationship has
matured to being a loving interaction, a new behavioral focus is required to
keep the passion and the partnership intact and intense.
is behavior, simple to understand but challenging to sustain, is caring.
ink for a moment of every person you have known on more than a casual
basis, such as family, friends, colleagues, and mentors. en ask yourself:
“Which of these individuals would I hold in highest esteem and carry out their
wishes most willingly?” Chances are that person is someone who you believe
cares about you. You sense this in their actions and in their general demeanor.
Trying to deﬁne caring is a bit like deﬁning the term pornography. When a
Supreme Court justice was asked to deﬁne that term he answered, “I can’t
deﬁne it, but I can recognize it when I see it.” So, too, with caring. To try to
use words to capture the essence of caring leaves us struggling to recognize the
emotional, deeply passionate component of what caring is all about, even
though we can readily recognize it when we experience it. Caring is about the
heart rather than the head. It is about a relationship that goes beyond robotic,
intellectual, surface interactions and taps into the very essence of who we are at
our innermost level of feeling.
