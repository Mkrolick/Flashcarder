what the other person does. You will be amazed at the ﬂurry of nonverbal
activity  that takes place when people meet. You will be even more amazed that
you went through your entire life and never recognized the nonverbal cues you
have displayed.
Eyebrow ﬂashes can be sent over long distances. If you are interested in
meeting someone who is across a crowded room, send an eyebrow ﬂash and
watch for a return signal. If a reciprocating eyebrow ﬂash is sent, further
involvement is possible. No return signal could indicate a lack of interest.
erefore, you can use eyebrow ﬂashes as a kind of early warning system to
help you determine if the person you are interested in is interested in you. e
lack of a return eyebrow ﬂash might save you from an awkward moment, or
outright rejection, and indicate that your best course of action is to look
elsewhere for a more receptive individual to approach.
