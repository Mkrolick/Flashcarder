POSTURAL POSITIONING
A good way to test for rapport is to note the posture of the two individuals
who are interacting. Two behaviors are of particular value.
INWARD LEANING
Individuals lean toward people or things they like and distance themselves
from those they don’t. People who are in good rapport lean toward one
another. During predeployment training for interrogators going to Iraq, I
noticed that the majority of the soldiers were leaning backward during the ﬁrst
hour of my presentation. Just prior to the break, using an empathic statement,
I told them I didn’t feel as though I was making a connection with them. e
soldiers nodded in unison. ey told me they had been to Iraq on two
previous deployments and the material I was teaching them was too basic. I
told them to take a ﬁfteen-minute break and I would go to my oﬃce to
retrieve the advanced training manual. Had I not noticed the lack of rapport
between myself and the class during the ﬁrst hour, the entire training session
would have been wasted.
OPEN POSTURE
People who are in good rapport assume an open body posture. An open
posture signals attraction and openness to communication. It consists of
gestures that include uncrossed legs and arms, a high rate of hand movements
during speech, palms-up displays, a slight forward lean, and the display of
friend signals. is communicates warmth, trust, and friendliness. To add to
the impact of open posture, one can use head nodding, head tilts, and verbal
encouragers such as “I see,” “Uh-huh,” or “Go on.”
A person experiencing good rapport does not feel threatened by the person
with whom they are interacting and therefore is comfortable assuming an open
posture. An individual who feels threatened in the same situation tends to
assume a closed body posture to protect himself from a threat or perceived
threat. A closed posture can also indicate a lack of interest.
