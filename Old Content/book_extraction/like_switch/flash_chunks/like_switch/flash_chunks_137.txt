Term: Effect of Physical Beauty in Internet Communications
Definition: The impact of physical beauty is less significant in online communications unless an image is included in an internet profile. However, it's not uncommon for individuals to lie on their internet profiles to appear more attractive. The lack of a physical reference for contrast can lead to misattributions and an increased risk of falling for a catphish.

Term: Rapport Building in Internet Communication
Definition: Online rapport building is primarily dependent on written text, with disclosure of personal information playing a significant role. Because of the anonymous nature of the Internet, people tend to disclose more personal information quickly, leading to vulnerabilities with the absence of verbal and nonverbal cues indicating acceptance or rejection of the information shared.

Term: Increased Personal Disclosure in Online Communication
Definition: Without verbal or nonverbal cues indicating rejection, people tend to share more personal and sensitive information online. This behavior furthers the online relationship more quickly than in face-to-face interactions, skipping a vital step of pacing the development of the relationship.

Term: Catphishing
Definition: The absence of a vital pacing step and nonverbal feedback during online communication increase the probability of being a victim of catphishing, the act of creating a fake profile on social media to deceive others.

Term: Emotional Investment in Internet Relationship 
Definition: The longer an online relationship continues, the deeper the emotional investment. However, this does not necessarily indicate compatibility. The intensity of shared sensitive information and the time invested in the relationship often create significant personal vulnerabilities, causing the engaged individuals difficulty in leaving the relationship.

Term: Relationship Development in Spying 
Definition: The steps required to develop close relationships or romantic relationships mirror those required to convince a person to become a spy. This process often involves careful information disclosure and pacing - skipping or rushing these steps might lead to unsuccessful operations.
