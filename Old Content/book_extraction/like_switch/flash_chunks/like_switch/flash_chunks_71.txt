Term: Hair flip
Definition: A non-verbal display usually accompanied by a momentary flip of the hair with the hand. Combined with mutual gaze, it's a strong positive sign of established rapport. Conversely, a hair flip without mutual gaze, or combined with broken eye contact, is a negative signal indicating a lack of rapport, often known as a “bitch flip.”
